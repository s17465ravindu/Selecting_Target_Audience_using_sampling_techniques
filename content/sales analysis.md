### Sales Analysis

-   The sales analysis graph shows the changes in sales over time.

-   The graph highlights two periods where sales are rising:
    December-January and April-May. These may be related to holiday shopping
    seasons or other factors that increase consumer spending during those
    months

-   By understanding the seasonality and trends in sales, the platform can
    optimize its operations to better meet the needs and preferences of its
    customers
