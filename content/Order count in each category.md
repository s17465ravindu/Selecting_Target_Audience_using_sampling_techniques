### Order Count In Each Category

-   It is worth noting that the order count varies widely across different
    categories, with some categories showing much higher or lower levels of
    activity than others. This suggests that there may be different drivers
    of demand for different types of products

-   The order count by category shows that the Mobile & Tablets category
    has the highest number of orders among all categories. This suggests
    that products in this category are in high demand and represent a
    significant portion of the platform's sales

-   In contrast, the Books category has the lowest number of orders among
    all categories. This may indicate a lower level of interest or demand
    for books on the platform compared to other categories
