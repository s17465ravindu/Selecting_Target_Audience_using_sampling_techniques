### State-Wise Customer Count

-   The state-wise customer count shows the number of customers in each of the 50 states in the United States.

-   The graph indicates that the two states with the highest number of
    customers are California (CA) and Texas (TX), which may reflect a higher
    level of demand or interest in the platform's offerings in these
    states.

-   The graph can provide useful insights into the platform's customer base
    and can inform decisions related to marketing, sales, and customer
    service. By understanding the distribution of its customers across
    different states, the platform can tailor its strategies and offerings
    to better meet the needs and preferences of each state
