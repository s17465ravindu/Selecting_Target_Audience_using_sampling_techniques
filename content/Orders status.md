### Orders Status

-   The order status breakdown shows that a significant portion of sales on
    the platform are canceled orders, with more than 100,000 orders falling
    into this category. This suggests that there may be issues with order
    fulfillment or customer satisfaction that are leading to a high rate of
    cancellations

-   On a positive note, there are still more than 80,000 orders that have
    been completed, indicating a substantial volume of successful
    transactions on the platform

-   The order status breakdown highlights the need for the platform to
    address the root causes of canceled orders and improve its order
    fulfillment processes. By reducing the number of canceled orders and
    increasing the number of completed orders, the platform can enhance its
    reputation and build a more loyal customer base.
